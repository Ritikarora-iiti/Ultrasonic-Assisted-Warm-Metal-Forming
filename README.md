# Ultrasonic-Assisted-Warm-Metal-Forming
Metal forming is a generalized process that includes a variety of manufacturing processes. The metal which is being processed is plastically deformed to shape it into the required geometry. The objective of this project is to study the effect of different heating temperatures that are above the cold working temperature but below the recrystallization temperature while performing the sheet metal forming.
The experimental setup was constructed by manufacturing the required components, such as a blank holder, die, and punch using the lathe. The whole setup was placed in a hydraulic press machine and the analysis with different samples was carried out at different temperatures and different frequencies. SolidWorks software was used to model the computer-aided designs of our components and the Abaqus CAE finite element software was used to simulate the complete deep drawing process, analyze the different parameters such as the distribution of stress on deformed material, reaction forces on the punch and the defects that can be aroused such as wrinkling, tearing during the deep drawing process. 
Furthermore, the experiments were carried out and the results were compared.
